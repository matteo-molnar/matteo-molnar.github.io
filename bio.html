                <p>Matteo Molnar was born on October 2nd, 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    For as far back as he can remember, he has been very
                    interested in computers and how they work, mostly interested in the different kinds of software
                    running on these computers. Matteo didn't really start to delve into the inner workings of software
                    until his second last year of high school and this tinkering lead to his choice of computer science
                    as a major in university.
